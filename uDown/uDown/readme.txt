This is the youtube downloader I created because i was bored, it uses requests module along with Beautiful soup 4 to parse html and download hd clips from GenYoutube.com

If that fails, it uses Selenium to open "Save From Net" and uses its properties to open firferfox, navigate to the download page and click on the download button.

Selenium uses the gecko model to link to firefox using webdriver so u need to place the geckodriver in /usr/local/bin folder for it excute properly

Enjoy.!!!
